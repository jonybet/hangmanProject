# hangmanProject

Write a PYTHON 3 program hangman.py that chooses a random secret word from a dictionary and allows the user to repeatedly guess a letter in the secret

word until they have made 8 guesses. Before each guess, print the number of guesses remaining and the letters guessed so far. At the end, print the

random word. Choose at least 30 words and it can be split into categories. For example State, City, or Country names. 

Create a scores tally to let the user know how many times they won or lost

Ask user if they want to keep playing or quit. 

Example Output:
